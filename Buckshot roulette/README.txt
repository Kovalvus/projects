This game is a recreation of "Buckshot Roulette" by Mike Klubnika.
This is only a fan project not meant to be a malicious ripoff.

I really liked the game so I tried to make it in python!

This project uses built in python libraries so you shouldn't have a problem launching it.
The game works only as a text game.

Made by Kovalvus on github
Enjoy :)
