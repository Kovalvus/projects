This game is a recreation of "Buckshot Roulette" by Mike Klubnika.
This is only a fan project not meant to be a malicious ripoff.

I really liked the game so I tried to recreate it in python!

This project uses built in python libraries so you shouldn't have a problem launching it.
The game works only as a text game as I don't really feel like making it with graphics via tkinter and also I never did a game in this format before so wanted to try it!

The game is currently in version 1.0, and as for now, I don't plan on updating it, but I may add some things like Double or Nothing mode in the future if I find time to do it :)

(The .exe file was made using auto-py-to-exe so you can trust it, but if you don't wanna take the risk you can just launch the code from BuckshotRoulette.py and it'll work just fine!)

Enjoy :)
