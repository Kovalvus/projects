This game is a recreation of "Buckshot Roulette" by Mike Klubnika.
This is only a fan project not meant to be a malicious ripoff.

I really liked the game so I tried to make it in python!

This project uses built in python libraries so you shouldn't have a problem launching it.
The game works only as a text game.

THE PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETE YET SO YOU MAY EXPERIENCE BUGS

Currently you can:
Access the various help menus in main menu
Play without end (I haven't implemented losing or winning yet)
You can play only on Game 1 now which means that items are unobtainable
