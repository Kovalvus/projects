Simple calculator project I made some time ago:

This calculator lets you do simple operations like:
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- powering
- square root

You can use:
- "()" brackets for more complex operations
- Pi number pasted as "(3.14)"
- float numbers using commas

Legend of potentially confusing symbols:
* -> multiplication
/ -> division
** -> powering

Enjoy :)
